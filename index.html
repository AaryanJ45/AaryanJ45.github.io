        <p><b>Topic:</b> The topic of our project is the Analysis of Battery/Plug-in Hybrid
        Electric Vehicles (BEV's and PHEV's) Registrations in Washington State.</p>

        <p><b>Some questions we are trying to answer: </b> Firstly, we want to do some trend analysis,
        looking at how the registrations of BEVs and PHEVs have changed over time in the state of Washington.
        We also want to look at what are the most popular models of BEVs and PHEVs in Washington using popularity
        and diversity statistics. We will also use hypothesis testing to look into relations about certain aspects 
        of the data, for example, looking at if there is a correlation between electric range and base MSRP in these
        electric vehicles. For machine learning predictions, we look to answer questions about if we can predict the 
        demand of BEVs vs. PHEVs based on demographic and geographic factors, and if there are distinct clusters of counties
        or regions based on their electric behicle registration patterns.</p>

        <p><b>Why is answering these questions important: </b> Answering these questions are important because firstly, 
        understanding the trends and factors influencing electric vehicle registrations can inform state policies on 
        infrastructure development, like charging stations, and elective vehicle purchase incentives. Analyzing the shift
        to electirc vehicles can also help quantify the environmental benefits, which is very important for future planning.
        This data could also be valuable for car manufacturers and stakeholders in the electric car market to understand 
        consumer trends</p>

        <!-- Data curation part of the project -->
        <h1><u>Data Curation</u></h1>
        <p><b>Source of the data: </b>We got our data from the Data.gov website (<a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data">LINK</a>). 
        During this phase, we are going to be focusing on importing the data from the website and transforming it so that it's ready for analysis.</p>

        <p>In this tutorial, we are going to be using data of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered 
            through Wasington State Department of Licensing (DOL). The data includes information about the make, model, year, electric range, base MSRP, and the county. 
            After going to the <a href="Data.gov">Data.gov</a> and finding a dataset that best fit our project, we downloaded this dataset as a CSV file. This allows us to
            easily import the data into our Python environment, and using Pandas, to set up a a data frame in order to manipulate the data.
        </p>

        <h4> What is Pandas? </h4>
        <body>
            <p>Pandas is a fast and flexible open soure data analysis and manipulation tool, specifically designed for the Python programming language.
            We highly recommend referring to the following resources to install pandas and an environment to run this: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html">https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html">https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html</a></li>
            </ul>
        </body>
        
        <p>Once we have downloaded the data as a CSV file, we can import this data into our Python environment using this code:</p>
        <code>
            import pandas as pd
            data = pd.read_csv('Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv')
        </code>
        <p>Here, 'Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv' is the name of the CSV file that we are going to be extracting data from.</p>
